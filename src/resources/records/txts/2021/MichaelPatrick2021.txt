commentS
On October 22nd, 2021, I became aware of a stock transaction made by a family trust. This transaction occurred on January 22, 2021.
I do not have a decision-making role in the trust; but my wife and sons are beneficiaries, so I am bound to report certain details. On
October 25th, 2021, I contacted the Committee on Ethics to note this oversight and ensure correct reporting. I reported the
transaction to the Clerk of the House on November 3, 2021, and paid the statutory remedy of a $200 late fee.
